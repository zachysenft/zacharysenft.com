													<h3><strong>Personal Background</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>I grew up in Cleveland, OH and became a big Cleveland Browns and Cavaliers fan. In my free time,
													you can most likely find me spending time with my family and friends, watching my beloved Tottenham
													Hotspur FC from London, or learning a new technology that has captivated my interest. I frequently
													take part in Leetcode algorithm competitions and enjoy solving many types of puzzles. I have also
													recently been fostering dogs from a local Baltimore shelter as things have been remote due to Covid.<br><br>
													I also enjoy researching the stock market and cryptocurrency, traveling and exploring new places,
													listening to music, and staying active in whatever way possible.

													<h3><strong>More About Me</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p> I started my college career pursuing a lifelong dream - playing soccer at a division one school
													on an athletic scholarship. As time went on, I realized I had developed a new goal, one that
													would require me to attend a more challenging academic school. I transferred after the season 
													to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH from La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA.
													I still played soccer and fulfilled another dream of mine in the process - becoming an All-American
													in college soccer. Accompanied with other personal awards, I led my team in goals and assists every
													year, as we made school history by making it to the Elite 8 of the NCAA tournament. It was really
													special to share this experience with my best friends and family.

													<h3><strong>More About My Technical Interests</strong></h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													I am very skilled in Python, C++, and Java programming languages, and have an advanced
													understanding of Matlab, SQL, JavaScript, React, and Swift. I have used PowerBI for data 
													visualization in addition to the technologies listed prior. My passion lies in the challenges
													of development under the restrictions that a language has. I love to solve puzzles and being 
													a software engineer provides the opportunity to be challenged and take on these problems every
													day. 
												</p>
												<p>I am searching for an entry-level or mid-level position upon my graduation from Johns Hopkins
													with a M.S. in Computer Science. I believe my coursework along with my experience and passion 
													set me apart from other candidates, because of my record of going above and beyond. Please feel
													free to reach out to my previous supervisor, Joy Saunders, at jpeterso@jhu.edu for additional
													information about my work ethic.<br><br>

													My experience as an Information Technology and Data Analyst Intern under Joy was very successful
													in helping me develop technical skills as well as soft skills in the workplace. I was challenged daily 
													with data warehousing concerns along with intelligent design principles for a university with large 
													amounts of data. Additionally, my Python programming skills were finely tuned with the many scripts
													needed to automate data cleaning and manipulation. I also was challenged with performing business
													analysis and developing data models in PowerBI to present to higher-ups to make informed decisions.
													<br><br>
													My experience as a Software Engineer Intern at TutorDudes Services was also very successful and saw
													the completion and launch of our Asteroid-Fighter  elementary math application. The team was tasked
													with completing the project on a tight deadline, and through an agile development life cycle we
													were able to finish and launch the application under my lead. I learned a lot about interacting
													with others in a professional environment and how to get the best out of each member on the team 
													depending on their personality and what motivates them. Additionally I further developed my own
													technical skills in Java, Swing, and how to see a project through to completion.
													
													</p>
												<p><strong>So, why should you hire me?</strong><br>
													I'm no stranger to hard work, I have a proven track record of seeing commitments through to completion.
													My positive attitude and outlook companied with my dedication and passion for the position will not only
													make me a good member of your team, but an <strong>exceptional</strong> one. I am the type of person that
													is not afraid to ask for help when I don't know the answer, but know that I will do everything possible to
													solve the problem on my own first. To be plain and simple, I may not know every language, or technology that
													may be outlined in the job description, but I can guarantee you will find no candidate that will work harder
													to learn and thrive in the position.
