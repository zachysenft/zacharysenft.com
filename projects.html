													<h3>Virtual Clue-Less</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													Clue-Less was a project I accomplished with four others in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
													We were tasked with developing a game that allows players to play across a network, with subcomponents
													of a database, game-board interface, server interface, and client interface. I played a key role in the 
													group as the lead programmer. My main duties consisted of subsystem design and game logic development
													in our specified language (Java). I also oversaw the database connection as I am well-versed in SQL and 
													assisted developing the interfaces using the Java Swing framework.  
												</p>
												<p>
													This project was especially challenging as the group was tasked with starting the project without
													any set rules or guidance in place. As a result, the team chose to follow an agile development life
													cycle and worked in sprints through our four defined periods. In our first phase, we defined our 
													subsystems and developed a document detailing the precise requirements for the overall application.
													Additionally, we collaborated on UML class diagrams to outline the classes and back-room functionality
													that the game requires to properly run. Once this was completed, we were able to develop our skeletal
													system with the main components and ensure that they were connected. Next was the base game logic
													development, where I took the lead and oversaw the integration between our back-end code and our
													front-end interfaces. Finally, we collaborated by designing each interface such that it properly 
													reflected what is going on in the game and was connected via network. Each increment was accompanied 
													by a demo that outlined what we accomplished during the sprint and what our goals are for the upcoming
													increments. This project was extremely valuable in further developing my teamwork and collaboration 
													skills in a professional, software engineering environment alongside the soft skills it takes to be
													a good team member.
												</p>
												<p>
													This project showcases my technical abilities, my strength interacting with others in a professional
													environment, and my management skills as I took on a lead role in the development. Both technical and
													soft skills I learned in this experience are what I am looking forward to nurturing at my future
													position and am excited to build upon! Positive experiences such as this one are what further motivates 
													me and reminds me that I am on the right path to do what I want in my career.

												<h3><br><br>What's To Come</h3>
												<p>
													I am currently working on a few things in my free time, the main one being a Python application
													that is capable of tracking my spending and generating month-to-month expense reports. This will
													combine Python with a MySQL database and a cell phone text-prompted input to the database. The 
													purpose of this project is to showcase my skills and ability to connect subsystems, but also to 
													hold myself accountable. This is the 'ZachTrack' application.

													<h3>Machine Learning Algorithm Analysis</h3>
													<img src="images/ml_cover.png" style="width:225px;height:200px;">
												</header>
												<p>
													This was an exploratory project in machine learning in which I implemented and analyzed
													the complexity of a linear regression and lasso regression. The scripting was done via Python
													without the use of external libraries other than numpy and pandas. I utilized a Jupyter Notebook
													to couple my algorithm code with my analysis of the complexity. This project challenged me as both
													a programmer and computer scientist, as I was tasked with developing algorithms that trains itself
													to fit a dataset, as well as optimizing and analyzing the algorithms.

													<h3>WhatsHappenin'</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													WhatsHappenin' is a super exciting project I am working on with a small team. We are a startup 
													that is currently finishing up developing our product, and therefore I cannot give too much information
													about our work. However, WhatsHappenin' is an application that I believe will revolutionize the way
													young adults make social plans. It is a social network that allows you to create events along with 
													a specified location on a map, including what type of event it is. It can easily be applicable across
													many organizations and will save the trouble of texting many people the details of an event individually
													or will cut down on the need for large group-texts.
